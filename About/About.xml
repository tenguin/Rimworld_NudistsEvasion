~2.0 update!
Dodge and evasion have been reworked to scale based on "Apparel Mass", which enables all types of light armor evasion builds instead of being useful only for nudism playthroughs!
In additon, balance has been adjusted after mathing and testing various values. Existing users are recommended to the go the mod options and press "Reset" to update to the latest values!

Backstory:
While there are obvious disadvantages to not having armor or protective clothing, it would be a mistake to underestimate the speed, agility, and footwork of an unhindered warrior. 

To increase the diversity of apparel choices and viability of nudist playthroughs, this mod gives lightly armored and naked colonists a bonus to their melee dodge and a new ranged evasion mechanic.

Primary Changes:
When someone has an equipped apparel mass of less than 6 kg (configurable in options), they will increasingly gain the following bonuses until reaching the maximum bonus when they're fully naked:
1. 40% Melee dodge.
2. 40% Ranged evasion.
3. 15% Movement speed when drafted.
(The ability to dodge and evade goes down as colonists' movement ability goes down!)
(Values also configurable in the options).

Instead of only wearing heavy armor, dodge/evasion builds using lighter armors are now possible! While potentially riskier, lightly armored and Nudist playthroughs are now very much a viable alternative!

(Bonuses apply multiplicatively to the existing accuracy formula, so there will never be a 100% chance to dodge or for a shot to miss).
